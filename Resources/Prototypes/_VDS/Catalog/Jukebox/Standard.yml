# HEY!! MAKE SURE YOUR FILES AREN'T TOO LOUD (PEAK OF -2.7 dB) AND ARE IN MONO!! THANKS!!
# IF THEY'RE NOT IN MONO YOU'LL BORK THE POSITIONAL AUDIO SYSTEM AND YOUR SOUNDS WON'T ATTENUATE AT A DISTANCE!
# SO BE CAREFUL!!
# ALSO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ASKING FOR A JUKEBOX VOLUME SLIDER
# FOR SOME REASON THAT SHIT IS ONLY EXPOSED ENGINE SIDE AND YOU MIGHT GO INSANE THINKING ABOUT HOW STUPID THAT IS
# I LOVE ROBUST TOOLBOX!!
