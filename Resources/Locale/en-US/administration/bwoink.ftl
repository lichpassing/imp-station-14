    Issues may be handled without a response.

bwoink-system-introductory-message =
    You may use AHelp for issues, questions, asking for bits, events, and so on!
    We only ask you to be responsible in your usage.

    --=== EXAMPLE USAGE ===--
    --Reporting an issue--
    Please describe the issue in detail, and assume that we have no first-hand knowledge of the situation.

    --Questions--
    Ask away! Whether that be gameplay questions or anything else.
    We will not divulge any information about the current round.

    --Asking for a bit--
    'Bit' in this context refers to you wanting to do something or have a minor thing happen that would require admin assistance.
    Bits can be funny, serious, related to your character's arc, or just you asking us to haunt you and so on!

    We're happy to aid your bits.

    --Asking for an event--
    'Event' in this context refers to something that drastically changes the round's story/gameplay. We'll gladly accept your ideas, big or small.

    For big events, please send a modmail on Discord instead, describing your event and what we'd need to do to help you accomplish it.

    If it's a smaller event, AHelping during the pre-round lobby is fine too.

    --Anything else--
    We don't bite. Ask!

    --=== NOTES ===--
    We're a small team, so please do be patient with us! We're also players, too, so sometimes we might not be able to do a sudden bit request because we're playing! This doesn't mean don't ask, it's just something to be mindful of.

    We have a right to deny bits/events for any reason, which we'll mainly do if it's something that we think would ruin the fun for others, something we don't know how to do, or if we just have low energy that day.

    All messages are relayed to us on Discord.
